## Our focus

- What you covered in PHS 552
   - What is regression
   - How to build a mean model
   - Models for different types of outcomes (normal, logistic, Poisson, etc)
   - What happens when constant variance breaks?

. . .

- What we'll focus on here:
   - Same foundations, different style: what happens when observations **are not** independent
      - Clustered data
      - Longitudinal/repeated measures data
      - Time-to-event/survival data

## Outline

- Review of generalized linear models, weighted least squares
- Model misspecification
- What are clustered & longitudinal studies?
- EDA
- Linear mixed effect models (LMEs), generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs)
- Generalized estimationg equations (GEEs)
- Longitudinal smoothing
- Time-to-event/survival analysis
