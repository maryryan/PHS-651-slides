## A new type of clustering

Previously we have discussed how outcome observations can be clustered due to some kind of group membership that often dealt with where the observations came from in space or societal/institutional membership

- Geographic groups (city, county, state, region, apartment/residential building, etc)

- Institutional groups (schools, school districts, etc)

We briefly touched on scenarios where clustering occurred because we obserevd multiple observations for a single person:

- Eyes in someone's head

- Person answering multiple questions on one survey

. . .

A common element between these were that all observations came from the [same moment in time]{.alert}

- We also call this a type of [cross-sectional]{.alert} (or latitudinal) sampling

- This is about estimating the effect of an exposure on an outcome at a particular moment in time

What if we wanted to observe how an exposure affects an outcome [across time?]{.alert}

---

## Longitudinal data

[Longitudinal data]{.alert} occur when a research subject is observed repeatedly through time

- Primary goal of longitudinal data collection is to characterize [change in response over time]{.alert} and how factors/exposures impact that change

. . .

What's wrong with a cross-sectional study?

- Only observe how exposure impacts outcome at a particular moment

- No understanding of whether outcome changed while exposure was applied or whether it was always low/high

---

## Types of longitudinal studies

There are (generally) 2 types of longitudinal studies:

1. Individuals recruited at a particular chronological time point and repeatedly observed
   
   - Individuals match up on chronological time (date), but not necessarily lifecycle time
   
   - Sometimes called panel data

2. Individuals recruited at a particular lifecycle point and repeatedly observed

   - e.g., from birth, from exposure
   
   - Individuals may not match up on chronological time
   
   - Sometimes called cohort data
   
Putting a specific label isn't as important as understanding how similar you would expect individuals to be at [study baseline]{.alert} (they're first visit in the study)

---

## Longitudinal vs repeated cross-sectional data

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Similar to "true" longitudinal data are [repeated cross-sectional data]{.alert}

- In repeated cross-sectional studies, the same survey/assessment/measurement is collected repeatedly across time

- However, the subjects at Time 1 are usually not the same as the subjects at Time 2

Repeated cross-sectional studies may be longitudinal for a cluster/group (if that's how the data collection is designed), but not for the individual people

- i.e., repeated cross-sectional observation of counties each year, but the people responding in a county are different from year to year

This will limit how we can generalize our conclusions

## Longitudinal vs repeated cross-sectional data

For temporal trend in response, why isn't repeated cross-sectional data ideal?

1. Systematic difference between cohorts (time-point samples)

2. Between-individual variability

3. No info on individual-level trajectory

4. Cost (need to re-recruit at each time point)

By comparing responses at different time points from the same subject, longitudinal analysis removes systematic and random difference between individuals, provides direct info on individual-level trajectory, and reduces study cost

---

## Longitudinal data structure

Most longitudinal data is structured such that the outcome and exposure are measured at baseline, and only the outcome is re-measured at each time point:

![](long-structure.png)

- We can also structure longitudinal data to repeatedly observe the exposure variable or other variables along with the outcome, but generally want all these observations to be happening at the same timepoint


---

## Complications of longitudinal data

Longitudinal data comes with some complications - some we've seen before and some that are new

. . .

1. Repeated measures on individuals are correlated

   - Basic unit: individual at time x
   
   - Cluster/group unit: individual (across time)

2. Variability often heterogeneous across time

3. We may or may not expect an individual's observations to be correlated the same across time

   - Would you expect your blood pressure today to have the same amount of correlation with your BP in a year versus in 10 years?
   
4. Greater possibility for [missing data]{.alert}

   - Missing visits, study dropout, death...
   
5. Possibility for differential visit timing

   - An annual visit for one person might be 9 months after their last, while for another it might be 18 months after

## Example: Treatment of lead-exposed children trial

Exposure to lead during infancy is associated with substantial deficits in tests of cognitive ability

- Chelation treatment of children with high lead levels usually requires injections and hospitalization

- A new (at the time) agent, Succimer, can be given orally

To test the effect of Succimer, a (longitudinal) randomized trial was conducted examining changes in blood lead level during course of treatment

- 100 children randomized to placebo or Succimer

- Measures of blood lead level at baseline, 1, 4 and 6 weeks

## Example: Six Cities study of air pollution and health

Researchers wanted to study lung function growth in children and adolescents

- Most children were enrolled between the ages of six and seven and measurements were obtained annually until graduation from high school

We'll focus on a randomly selected subset of the 300 female participants living in Topeka, Kansas

- Response variable: Volume of air exhaled in the first second of spirometry manoeuvre, FEV1
